Use your favorite framework with Netlify CMS.

`netlify-db` will parse markdown files generated by Netlify CMS, and create a single json file you can use as your database. Get the performance benefits of a static page generator, while still using your favorite front-end setup.

## Installation

Firstly, install the package using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
yarn add netlify-db --dev
```

or

```bash
npm install --save-dev netlify-db
```

## Usage

Once that's done, you can run this command inside your project's directory:

```bash
netlify-db create <admin folder> <database folder>
```

Example:

```bash
netlify-db create public/admin src
```

That's it! :tada:

## Options

`-w` `--watch` to watch markdown files and write to the database.
`-n` `--name` name for the database. ex: `--name my-database`
